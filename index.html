                    <h2 class="mb-5">How "IT" All Started</h2>
                    <p>Before I began my career in Cloud Computing, I owned a successful clothing brand named IceDream. Eventually, I ventured into web and graphic design where my interest to learn about computers, and how the function grew. I began pursuing a B.S. in Software Development but switched my major to Computer Networks and Cyber Security because I fell in love with cyber, due to the vulnerabilities and how everything is connected. After taking two courses on Cloud Computing, an AWS fanatic was born.
                    <br>
                    <br>Upon the completion of my Bachelors, I immediately started my Masters program on Cloud Computing Architecture. I purchased every book I could to increase my knowledge on the subject and joined every group I could to soak up the wealth of information. The ability to become a one-man datacenter, in a sense, for a company excited me. Knowing that I could take a company to the next level with security, scalability, redundancy, and reduced cost, blew my away.      
                    <br>
                    <br>I am now taking on every project I can and learning more about containers such as Docker and Kubernetes. I am also learning about different automation such as Ansible, Terraform, and CloudFormation. Day by day I am increasing my knowledge and proficiency in cloud computing with AWS and Azure. This is my passion, and I am ready for all the opportunities ahead. </p>

                    <p>My hobbies consist of 3D printing or addicting manufacting and reading. Learning new things is great because I get a chance to see another person view point on topic.
